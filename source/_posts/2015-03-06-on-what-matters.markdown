Hi there!

So, you think you've got a great knowledge of technology? Let me tell you something.

**It doesn't matter!**

Sorry for disappointing you, but it's true! Information technology is developing so fast most of your knowledge will become outdated very quickly. It's the fly in the ointment of all programmer guys.

What matters is your ability to *learn quickly*.

It's not only important in programming. It is something that would make your life much easier and enjoyable.

I believe it's important to develop a learning skill. It's possible, actually. You just need to practice learning!

There is a lot of activities around which you can choose for learning. Pick whatever is interesting to you! It's fun, it's entertaining, it would make your life diverse!

It's a great deal by two main reasons. Firstly, it's incredibly easy to gain a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time on the beginning. Have you heard about the *learning curve*? It proves my point.

Secondly, when you gain a knowledge of one activity, you start realize many others. As it says in the samurai book written by *Yamamoto Tsunetomo*,

> If you can understand one affair, you will understand eight.

There are many wise thoughts in the book, which is called **Hagakure**, meaning *Hidden by the Leaves*. I was going to make it an ***inspiration share*** of the day, but I would rather mention the movie which inspired me to read the book, which is the **Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai** by *Jim Jarmusch*.

That was a programming trivia for today.
