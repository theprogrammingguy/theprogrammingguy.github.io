Hello!

As I said [earlier](/blog/2015/03/04/do-it-wrong/), doing something is a great approach to learning it.

By the last week I've understood an important rule.

**The most horrible thing to do in order to achieve something is to make a routine from the process of doing that.**

<!-- more -->

Think about it! It's true!

The saddest thing about it is that I always used to give myself promises to do the same little thing on a daily basis. It never worked, although it would, if I managed to do it. But such challenges don't work for me and, I believe, wouldn't for most of people.

My advice about [how to move fast](/blog/2015/03/09/moving-fast/) is still valid. But you need to combine it with [flexibility](/blog/2015/03/08/how-to-get-things-done/) and do something on regular basis, but keep changing how you do it to prevent it from becoming a routine.

That was a programming trivia for today.

The ***inspiration share of today*** is **The Beatles** band. These guys rock!
