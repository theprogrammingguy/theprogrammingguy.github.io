Nice to see you!

I've [already told](/blog/2015/03/06/on-what-matters/) you how easy it is to start learning something new.

For example, I started [Chinese for Beginners](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-chinese) course on Coursera today. It's not like I have plenty of free time, but I was curious and I'd like to have learned Chinese at some point in the future. As well as Japanese and Spanish, maybe.

Anyway, I need to confess to cheating on you. I promised to write on a daily basis, but actually I've never managed to produce posts in time. From the moment of creation of this blog I was late by a day with posting until weekends, when, although it was a perfect time to speed up, I decided I had more important things to do and screwed that up.

So, these are strong evidences I'm doing something wrong. I could give up like I've done too many times before, or I could find out a way to get things done. Obviously, I need to simplify my posting routine.

Here goes my main thought for today.

**Be flexible to get things done!**

It feels like a right thing to do. I've got so much philosophy to share with the world, and each of my ideas encourages me to continue blogging. I would mention all those reasons to keep going, but each of them deserves a separate item.

I know, it might be kind of disappointing to read a blog about programming full with motivational crap. However, I have some interesting thoughts and feel a strong necessity of expressing them.

That was a programming trivia for today.

The ***inspiration share*** of today is **The Sound and the Fury** novel written by **William Faulkner**.

P.S. By the way, what I did on weekends is I was watching lectures about [Operating Systems and Systems Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgQo4JkN4Bw&list=PL3289DD0D0F0CD4A3).
