Hello!

Today I'll give you a nice tip about how to take an advantage over other people in most activities.

It's simple but efficient tip and, although it's ridiculously obvious, it's still very powerful, because people hardly ever use it in practice.

It is something that helped me in many situations, and I still use it when it's important for me to succeed.

Make sure you get this right.

It is a great way to take advantage over other people by doing preliminary research on the subject of what you are going to do.

This is pretty obvious, right? Just make and extra effort! This isn't so hard, is it?

Don't learn on your mistakes! Learn on others mistakes!

Let me give you an example.

It was a long time ago when I discovered the existence of online multiplayer games. It was a wonderful experience creating a character in Ragnarok Online video-game, seeing other people playing together, researching a new world.

I spent a month in that beautiful fairy tale. I hardly reached the fifteenth level.

Then things started to become more structured. I found guides on forums how to grow the level of your character, where to find monsters suitable for your level, what skills to improve.

It kind of turned everything upside down. The mysterious atmosphere was ruined, however what I obtained instead was the joy of progressing incredibly fast.

It turned out that I messed up my characteristics, so I had to create another character. In a day I grew more levels than I'd grown in a month. It was unbelievable how much time I'd wasted before.

That lesson affected my entire life.

After two years when I decided to try poker I spent a week learning rules and strategies before I was ready to actually play my first game, and it wasn't even for real money. I wasn't really good, because there are things you can learn only in practice. However I was definitely better than the most of first time players.

That was a programming trivia for today.

P.S. I mentioned poker because it teached me another valuable lesson, but I'll speak about it another time.

P.P.S. Today's ***inspiration share*** is **Scrubs** TV series.
