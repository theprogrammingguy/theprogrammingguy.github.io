Welcome!

Let's continue our talk about learning. Just to make it complete.

Assuming you've passed the fast-learning period of the [*learning curve*](/blog/2015/03/06/on-what-matters/), what would you do to effectively improve your knowledge?

Or, maybe, you're facing a challenging task that needs to be done. What would be the best approach to complete it?

At first you'd try doing it at once, but no matter how much effort would you put into it, it wouldn't be very helpful. Maybe, the task is so complicated if you rushed it you'd end up with a huge mess.

Sometimes it's really exhausting to constantly fail in something.

What works for me in such situations is the next principle.

**Moving fast is moving slow, but every day.**

The only thing you can do to complete something is to find a comfortable tempo and to keep on moving forward. To be most productive you also should [stay flexible](/blog/2015/03/08/how-to-get-things-done/).

That was a programming trivia for today.

The ***inspiration share of today*** is **On the Road** novel by *Jack Kerouac*.
