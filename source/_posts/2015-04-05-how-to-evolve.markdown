So, I've been absent for a while. Wonder what I was doing? Let me tell you!

At first I finished watching the Operating Systems and System Programming free lectures course by US Berkeley I told you about. Well, I didn't watch all of it, just about 30%. But that was quite interesting. It turned out that I've already heard most of material in my university, so I decided to switch on something new and more useful in practice.
<!-- More -->
I started [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Stanford University at Coursera. I find it amazing. Currently I've done 50% of it, but lecturer said by now I should know 90% of what most machine learning folks in Silicon Valley know. I even implemented [gradient descent algorithm](https://github.com/FireFry/machine-learning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/burakovv/GradientDescentApp.java) with feature scaling.

Then to summarize my programming knowledge I created a [site](https://sites.google.com/site/buraknowledge/) on Google Sites. I think it's quite helpful to keep my knowledge structurized. It's easy to see what needs to be worked on.

The thing is it's time for me to evolve. I'm working hard these days to change from inside. I'm trying to develop a mind state suitable for creativity and to put my mind into this state. It's hard to explain briefly but my notion about this originates from Ericksonian hypnosis. I'm going to make a book about his methods, which is called **My Voice Will Go With You**, ***the inspiration share of today***.

Anyway, I believe that if you want to change your life in one way or another most of the work you need to do is inside you mind. If you succeed in developing a right approach to effectively move towards your dream then nothing is impossible for you.

After all, you cannot change the world around you, but what you can change is your attitude.
