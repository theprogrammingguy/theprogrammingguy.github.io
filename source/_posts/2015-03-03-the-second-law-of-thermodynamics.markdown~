Welcome back!

Remember the *Second Law of Thermodynamics?*

> The state of entropy of the entire universe, as a closed isolated system, will always increase over time.

You may wonder what those fancy terms of physics have to do with software engineering. The answer is ***a lot!***

The law can be applied to development process. What it means is each time you add new features to your project, the source code becames more messed up *unless* you make an ***extra effort*** to *keep it simple.*
